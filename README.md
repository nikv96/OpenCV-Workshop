# OpenCV-Workshop

*Disclaimer - This workshop was made for the $PATH to iNTUition workshop series leading to [iNTUition v3.0](http://intuition.ieeentu.com).*

OpenCV is an open source library of pre implemented computer vision algorithms. OpenCV was implemented in C++ and meant to be used in C++ but now we have bindings for OpenCV in Python, Java, Matlab and even in node.js.

## Task 0

Clone this repository or [download](https://github.com/nikv96/OpenCV-Workshop/archive/master.zip) the zip file from GitHub.

### Installations
1. Install [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (For OSX and Linux users, python 2.7 should be installed by default).
2. Add python to your system path. (For Windows users, navigate to This PC -> System Properties or Settings -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> Path -> Edit and then add ```C:\Python27``` and ```C:\Python27\Scripts``` to the Path).
4. Restart your terminal or command prompt.
5. On your terminal/command prompt enter ```pip install numpy``` to install numpy.
6. For OpenCV install instructions, refer [here](https://github.com/nikv96/OpenCV-Workshop/blob/master/install.md).
7. (Additional) Install a text editor such as [sublime text](https://sublimetext.com/2) to edit your code.
8. (Additional) For Windows users, I would advice downloading a bash shell such as [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Running the scripts
1. Navigate to the directory with the script in your command prompt or terminal. eg: ```cd <Path to Repository>/Task\ 1```.
2. Run on command prompt or terminal with ```python <script>.py```.

### Introduction
Images are seen by computers as a collection of pixels. A RGB image which appears to us as colored images would be seen by a computer as a collection of pixels whose values range from 0 to 255. A RGB image has 3 components for each pixel denoting Red, Green and Blue. A grayscaled image on the other hand would have 1 component denoting the intensity of the color black.

Computer vision makes use of these pixels to derive different conclusion about an image. A simple example would be - a transition from a pixel value of 0 to 1 is not very significant whereas a transition from 0 to 255 could be considered an edge.

## Task 1
Write a program to simply read and display an image with OpenCV. Use the ```cv2.imwrite()``` function to then, store this image in your directory.

## Task 2
Write a program to capture a video and display it with OpenCV. In addition, write the grayscaled frames to a file. Try to read this image in later.

## Task 3
Let us explore drawing functions. OpenCV allows you to draw on images with drawing functions. The options are lines, circles, rectangles, polygons and texts.

**Exercise** - Recreate the Olympics symbol as close as possible!

## Task 4
Let us now explore Image Operations. OpenCV-python stores images as numpy arrays. These arrays have several properties which turn out to be very useful factors of the images.

* Shape of the image returns the number of rows, columns and channels. The channels factor can determine whether the image is grayscaled or not.
* Size of the image returns the total number of pixels.
* Dtype of the image returns the datatype.

You can also pick a region of interest from this image.

Another operation is an Image Blend.

**Exercise** - Try to overwrite a region of the image with a black image.

## Task 5
Color spaces are an important concept in image processing. A few commonly known color spaces are RGB, HSV and GRAY. 

Color maps let you map known color spaces to other pixel values. A few known color maps are RAINBOW, AUTUMN and so on.

**Exercise** - Try to get the image looking close to a thermal camera output.

## Task 6
Canny Edge Detection is a commonly used computer vision algorithm to detect edges in images. We take a look at the transition from black to white in a grayscaled and if continuous elements map the same transition it can be determined as an edge.

## Task 7
HoughTransform is another commonly used computer vision algorithm to detect lines or circles in an image. HoughLine Transform makes use of the parametric equation of a line to determine if an edge is a line or not.

**Exercise** - Find an image online with two circles. Detect the two circles with OpenCV and connect the centers with a line.

## Task 8
HaarCascades is based on a paper by Viola and Jones on Rapid Object Detection. This algorithm can be used to train models to detect different types of objects.

**Exercise** - Extend the detector to detect eyes. Then, extend the code to detect faces and eyes in a video.
